I came here last week to give a talk about "&lt;a href="http://cdent.org/"&gt;C'Dent&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://acmeism.org/"&gt;Acmeism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://osdc.tw/2010/03/schedule_please_check_your_gun.html"&gt;Everyone&lt;/a&gt;" at the &lt;a href="http://osdc.tw/"&gt;2010 OSDC.tw&lt;/a&gt;. It has been a wonderful time of reconnecting with old friends, making new friends, solidifying old projects and learning new things about computers, society and living. I feel more alive than I have in a long time. So alive, that I actually feel compelled to blog about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the rub... I haven't blogged at all since the &lt;a href="http://act.osdc.fr/osdc2009fr/"&gt;last OSDC I attended in Paris&lt;/a&gt;, October 2009. A lot of blog worthy stuff has happened since then. I've been tempted to blog about this stuff, but when my fingers get near the keyboard, I realize that I really don't like blogging at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogging is about having to make up a cohesive story about something interesting to you, and mark that story in a point in time. Tweeting runs in the opposite direction... a couple words about what's on tv. Wikis are closer to what I usually want; write a new addition or revision to a concept that I write about all the time. But wikis have problems in conveying exactly what it is on my mind (about this old subject) at this new point in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've decided that this will be my last traditional blog post ever. The trip to Taiwan has redoubled my desire to write to the world about many many things, and very often. But you'll no longer find them in this crappy blog. I'll keep this crappy blog somewhere for posterity but everything new will be in a system that supports my ideals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to point out a piece of delicious irony here... When I logged into Blogger to write this final post, I saw &lt;a href="http://blogger-ftp.blogspot.com/2010/01/deprecating-ftp.html"&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt; saying that they were completely dropping their FTP blog publishing from existence on May 1st, 2010. This is the technique that my (old, crappy) blog uses. It looks like picked the perfect time to quit blogging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so much to say to you, dear world, about so many things. I won't do it all here in this final post. I will do it later today in my new xlog (I just can't say the "B" word again).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-3351143107188891408?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/3351143107188891408/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=3351143107188891408' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/3351143107188891408'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/3351143107188891408'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2010/04/goodbye-cruel-blog.html' title='Goodbye Cruel Blog'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-3408814263384016276</id><published>2009-10-04T08:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-04T08:58:24.411-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Ooooh Champs-Élysées</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Screen-shot-2009-10-04-at-5.42.14-PM-742757.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 319px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Screen-shot-2009-10-04-at-5.42.14-PM-742570.png" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Parisian host for &lt;a href="http://osdc.fr/"&gt;http://osdc.fr&lt;/a&gt; loves to run and so do I. Today he took me on a &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2Ovzc5"&gt;great tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2Ovzc5"&gt; of Paris&lt;/a&gt; by foot. We ran past lots of historic places including the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es"&gt;finish line of the Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; and we ended up under the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower"&gt;Eiffel Tower&lt;/a&gt;.

It was running a bit late so I was worried about making my connection. It turns out, there was absolutely nothing to worry about. My London flight got canceled. No rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They put me up in the DFW Grand Hyatt. Nice place for being stuck in the middle of nowhere. (Sorry TX, but it's true.) I really only had one problem left to solve. Who would rub lotion on my new back tattoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything you need is always around you... (if you are willing to be a dork. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some lotion on a towel, but that ended rubbing it off as quick as it got on. So I used a smaller cloth but had no way to reach the middle of my back.

I found this &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/pEfdn"&gt;beautiful half marathon distance route&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to run it right away, since it was such a beautiful day. It ended up being a perfect tour of scenic Seattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts and ends at Volunteer Park and goes around all of downtown and Lake Union. It goes through the Central District, the International District, all along the downtown waterfront, up to the Space Needle, over the Fremont Bridge, through Wallingford along the ship canal, and finally back over the Montlake bridge and up to Capitol Hill.

They run every Wednesday at 6:30pm, rain or shine, starting (and finishing) at Volunteer Park, on Capitol Hill in Seattle. Conveniently, this park is just a couple blocks from my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week, anywhere from 15 to 75 lads (and a few lasses) run about 4 miles. They have &lt;a href="http://www.seattlefrontrunners.org/runs/runType/WED"&gt;seven preplanned courses&lt;/a&gt; that they alternate betwixt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I decided to run all seven! (I also decided to map them using Google maps.) On Sunday I ran four in a row: &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/X2bRN"&gt;Riley's Revenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/0I8fw"&gt;Interlaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/WoqSe"&gt;16 Going on 17&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/eqEyx"&gt;Flat Four&lt;/a&gt;. Wednesday night I joined the FrontRunners in doing &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/DP1DL"&gt;22nd Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. Tonight (Thursday) I finished off the set with &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/LTaEo"&gt;Lakeview&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/PAqAC"&gt;Box in a Box&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've done all these courses with the group over the last year, but it's nice to run them by yourself too so you can take the time to really know them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the discipline of Google mapping them too, although the mapping software had issues with &lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/WoqSe"&gt;16 Going on 17&lt;/a&gt;. (It doesn't let you walk through the corners of 16th and Prospect or 17th and Republican.) The nice thing about the maps is you can modify them yourself. Give it a try.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-1039774657680628157?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/1039774657680628157/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=1039774657680628157' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/1039774657680628157'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/1039774657680628157'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2009/09/frontrunners-seven.html' title='FrontRunners Seven'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-6719138166001560477</id><published>2009-04-19T00:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-04-20T11:08:14.409-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Social Fork</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/span&gt; It appears that Socialtext has &lt;a href="http://github.com/socialtext/socialtext/"&gt;changed their mind&lt;/a&gt;. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Social_Fork-776080.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 215px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Social_Fork-775686.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the start of this month I was &lt;a href="http://vator.tv/news/show/2009-04-03-socialtext-raises-funds-and-cuts-stuff"&gt;laid off by my employer of the last 5+ years, Socialtext&lt;/a&gt;. I was Socialtext's first hire, presumably to gain my expertise from developing the open source wiki, &lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Socialtext has grown to employ as many as 50 people and has become the defacto leader in enterprise wiki software. They have branched out into other social software directions, and Kwiki, sadly, has all but died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the other people hired by Socialtext were leaders in open software. Socialtext, much to my delight, fully embraced open source, and actually opened all of their wiki source code several years ago. At the beginning of this year, Socialtext moved all of their code to &lt;a href="http://github.com/socialtext/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, making it even more publicly accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last autumn there was talk at work of closing the open repositories. My thought at the time was that if they did, someone should fork all the open code. That's just the right thing to do, since the point of open source code is to keep it open for as long as it is relevant. At that point, I bought the domain name &lt;a href="http://exoticslate.org/"&gt;exoticslate.org&lt;/a&gt;. This was in keeping with the tradition of our developers making anagrams from the word SOCIALTEXT. We had made up over 50, iirc, including OX IS CATTLE, TOXIC TALES and TEXT IS COAL. "Exotic Slate" (although having an extra 'e') is a fantasic representation of Socialtext's rich and elaborate wiki product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However Socialtext did not close the code, so I had yet another domain name with no good use. Fast forward...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks ago I asked Socialtext if I could take Wikiwyg, their richtext editor component (which I had been working on for years), and revive it as a general, open source solution. They graciously agreed. I'm currently in Oslo at the &lt;a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/"&gt;Nordic Perl Workshop&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall"&gt;Larry Wall&lt;/a&gt; and other old and new friends. Yesterday, at the workshop hackathon, I went to pull the Wikiwyg code out of &lt;a href="http://github.com/socialtext/socialtext/"&gt;Socialtext's main repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, only to find the the repository was no longer open! Once I confirmed that it was in fact, closed off, I knew what the &lt;a href="http://github.com/ingydotnet/exoticslate/"&gt;right thing to do&lt;/a&gt; was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure what will become of Exotic Slate. That's the exciting thing about open projects... they take on a life of their own. I hope that people will join me on irc.freenode.net/#exoticslate to take this journey forward.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-6719138166001560477?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/6719138166001560477/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=6719138166001560477' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6719138166001560477'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6719138166001560477'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2009/04/social-fork.html' title='Social Fork'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5978395370701501072</id><published>2009-02-08T01:19:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2009-02-08T01:22:02.880-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Bonsoir Chamonix</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF1038-786765.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF1038-786216.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long day of traveling, Yuval and I arrived in Chamonix. We had to drag over 100kg of our luggage around town but finally found a decent hotel. Hotel Pointe Isabelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hotel seems right in the middle of town. Right across from the McDonald's which is the first place we lugged to after getting off the bus. It was a good place to camp out with our gear while we looked for lodging. The micky-Ds has wifi here. It also has no gratuitous arches which made me feel slightly better about going to one after a couple decades hiatus. I had a salad, used the toilet and headed out on my journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, they really do speak French in France. I tried to remember this as I walked around. Soon I had to talk to my first hotel manager. "Bonjour!", I said, knowing I had played all my cards already. "Bonsoir..." he mumbled. Merde! I already screwed up. The old man showed me a room, but it was obvious we weren't meant to spend the night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hotel Isabelle is €30 more per night, but what's a few euro when the people are nice, you are in the middle of all the drunk brits, you get a free breakfast, and you have a nice little balcony to sit on. Yuval and I dragged our junk upstairs, stepped outside, poured a glass of wine and had a few minutes to relax and realize we were in our new hometown.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-5978395370701501072?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/5978395370701501072/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=5978395370701501072' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5978395370701501072'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5978395370701501072'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2009/02/after-long-day-of-traveling-yuval-and-i.html' title='Bonsoir Chamonix'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5200191008026480941</id><published>2009-02-05T06:29:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2009-02-05T07:41:13.074-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Eurö Ingy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0963-743349.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0963-742862.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ingy has left the building. Ingy has left the country. Ingy is in &lt;a href="http://london.pm.org/"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; today and making his way to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamonix"&gt;Chamonix&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. Ingy digs his new European digs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in October I was hosting the young and beautiful traveling Perl hacker, &lt;a href="http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/"&gt;Yuval Kogman&lt;/a&gt;, aka nothingmuch, aka Use Teh Moose. Like me, Yuval works remotely for an American software company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I asked him what he was doing for the winter and he said that he was moving to Chamonix France to spend 4 months backcountry snowboarding every day. Almost immediately I decided to join him. Never mind that I've never snowboarded a single time. Very soon I'll be doing it every day on Mont Blanc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken me the last 2.5 months to pack away all my belongings and pull up my roots again. (This is my 8th major move since 2000). I had to take an avalanche course and buy several thousand dollars worth of new equiptment, clothing and the season's pass. I had to explain to &lt;a href="http://www.socialtext.com/"&gt;my employer&lt;/a&gt; that working for a California company from France is actually even better than working from Seattle. I had to pack 50 odd boxes and say as many goodbyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I am on the road again. I'm starting the journey by paying a week long visit to my lovely friend, &lt;a href="http://cdent.tumblr.com/"&gt;Chris Dent&lt;/a&gt;, in the UK. I love his new home in Newbury. This is fortunate because my visa situation will require me to pay him a few more visits. An American can only spend 90 days of a 6 month period in continental Europe, without jumping through some ungodly visa hoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I am so excited to be a vagabond (with a great job). It is probably the best way to live, imho. While I hope to have fun playing in the snow each day, I am even more happy about spending my nights with a top notch Perl hacker, whom I can bounce my crazy ideas off. Life is good!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-5200191008026480941?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/5200191008026480941/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=5200191008026480941' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5200191008026480941'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5200191008026480941'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2009/02/euro-ingy.html' title='Eurö Ingy'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-3840490651242847812</id><published>2008-11-30T23:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-30T23:52:03.565-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Labret Comes of Age</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-227-741946.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-227-741942.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Birthday, lip ring. You are 18 years old today. You can vote and fight, but you still can't drink...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this little ring in my lip on November 30th 1990. Back then I was one of maybe 2 dozen people in the country, and most definitely the only guy who also had a Dilbert day job. There was one other guy in Chicago, a girl in NYC, the guy in the Research book and a handful in San Francisco of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first 5 years I got asked 50 times a day, every day "Did that hurt?". Never any other question, and even in San Fran! So weird. I always answered with respect, but sometimes I wanted to scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's a different world, and lip rings are completely passé, but I still like the little guy.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-3840490651242847812?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/3840490651242847812/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=3840490651242847812' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/3840490651242847812'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/3840490651242847812'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/11/labret-comes-of-age.html' title='The Labret Comes of Age'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-1311000108156980535</id><published>2008-11-23T01:08:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-23T13:25:30.364-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Tonight I'm Gonna Nibble Like It's 177.6</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-208-705792.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-208-705784.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0943-783183.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0943-782617.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget 199.9.

I hope so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sunday Recount&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0945-790578.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0945-790147.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to self: 14 mile runs are HARD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-1311000108156980535?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/1311000108156980535/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=1311000108156980535' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/1311000108156980535'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/1311000108156980535'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/11/tonight-im-gonna-nibble-like-its-1776.html' title='Tonight I&apos;m Gonna Nibble Like It&apos;s 177.6'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-6100662666485721071</id><published>2008-10-20T13:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-20T14:14:05.389-07:00</updated><title type='text'>NOPE</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/nope%282%29-796315.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/nope%282%29-796311.png" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dearest Lyssa is awesome as you can see for yourself.

So what's been going on since the last post?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I decided that losing weight was more fun than drinking. In the last 6 weeks I've managed to lose another 15 pounds. I can't remember when I last weighed under 190. Some time in the mid 90s I think. Now I'm shooting for 175 which I think was my weight when I was 13 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook disabled my account last week for using my name as my, um, name. It's all fixed up now. Ingy döt Net is legit and I even got them to lowercase the 'd' which you can't do using their site, and which, when I told them this, brought my dubious surname to their attention. More on this later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm hosting a couple of my favorite Nubile Perl Hackers, &lt;a href="http://blog.jrock.us/"&gt;jrockway&lt;/a&gt; from Chicago and &lt;a href="http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/"&gt;nothingmuch&lt;/a&gt; for Tel Aviv. I dressed both of them up in Lycra yesterday and made them bike around Lake Washington. One of them ended up in the hospital, but he's ok. Just a little scraped up. Nubile Perl Hackers are basically indestructible.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-6100662666485721071?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/6100662666485721071/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=6100662666485721071' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6100662666485721071'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6100662666485721071'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/10/nope.html' title='NOPE'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8636817299631628107</id><published>2008-09-05T21:06:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-06T02:17:01.576-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Tonight I'm Gonna Party Like It's 199.9</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/198-725066.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/198-724638.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems I haven't blogged since June 30th. Another thing I haven't done since June is drink alcohol. At the end of June I decided to go on the wagon for the Summer. Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was surprisingly easy, and not at all what I expected. I still did all the things I normally do, just stone sober. Interestingly I still got a hangover now and then! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August I started wondering when I should have a drink again. Some old drinking friends of mine came through town, but still I resisted. One day I came up with a brilliant idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been running a lot this summer. I started running with the &lt;a href="http://www.seattlefrontrunners.org/"&gt;Seattle Frontrunners&lt;/a&gt; running club which meets very close to my house. I've also been losing a little weight. So I thought, I'll drink again whenever the scale reads under 200 lbs. (I started the Summer around 220 lbs.) But the brilliant part is that I decided, not only that... &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; I drink I'll have to weigh in under 200 again in order to drink again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to drink good bourbon, wine and beer. I also like to weigh under 200 lbs, but in the last 10 years I've only been there a handful of days. Now I can use one to encourage the other! Brilliant, if I do say so myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I finally reached my goal for the first time. I woke up weighing 205. In a heavy workout I can lose around 7 lbs. I ate breakfast and lunch and some water. Around 5pm, after work, I decided to go for it. When I left the house I weighed 207.  When I got back from a quick 40 mile bike ride I weighed 200.5. I decided to go on a short 2-3 mile run. This actually got me down to 197.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom's up!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-8636817299631628107?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8636817299631628107/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8636817299631628107' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8636817299631628107'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8636817299631628107'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/09/tonight-im-gonna-party-like-its-1999.html' title='Tonight I&apos;m Gonna Party Like It&apos;s 199.9'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8865485424620632186</id><published>2008-06-30T14:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-30T16:26:37.494-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Coffee &amp; Diffie</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0881-736101.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0881-735486.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been hanging out in Palo Alto for the last week, meeting new coworkers at &lt;a href="http://www.socialtext.com"&gt;Socialtext&lt;/a&gt;, and visiting old friends. This last Saturday morning I made a new friend. I was waiting for my coffee and I spied a man sitting at a table using a laptop. Not a rarity around these parts by any means. But this was a man I was pretty sure I'd seen before at a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp"&gt;Foo Camp&lt;/a&gt; some years ago... "Excuse me, are you &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie"&gt;Whit Diffie&lt;/a&gt;?" "Yes, I am." "Hi, my name's Ingy döt Net"... Whit and I talked a bit and then I ran off to have breakfast with &lt;a href="http://www.lyssakaehler.net/"&gt;Lyssa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I ran into Whit again and we ended up talking for about an hour or so. I think I am cursed with this condition that when I meet someone with interesting ideas, I feel compelled to turn those ideas into projects. Whit left me with two interesting ideas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) While discussing the concept of "ingy.net", he impressed on my that a query url is a long lasting resource of good information on a subject. For instance &lt;a href="http://ingy.net"&gt;http://ingy.net&lt;/a&gt; (this blog) may become dead some day, but &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ingy+dot+net"&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=ingy+dot+net&lt;/a&gt; is much more robust. This led me to the idea of creating a blogware wrapper, that basically contained the latest google info about me, without me needing to lift a finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have create &lt;a href="http://i.ingy.net"&gt;http://i.ingy.net&lt;/a&gt;. For now, it is a simple redirect to google, but may be more interesting at some point. It might be an interesting meme to make domains like 'i.' or 'iii.' to mean, "general information". At this point "www" has very little meaning, but lots of people type it in regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Whit is interested in &lt;a href="http://www.nsa.gov/"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; factoids and during some talk about this and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki"&gt;Wikis&lt;/a&gt;, we came to the conclusion that a wiki would be a decent tool for a group of people with that common interest to share what they know. The main difference is that this data is more structured in nature and wikis are pretty much about free form content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This discussion rekindled my interest in two older ideas of mine: &lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/CogBase/CogBase.html"&gt;CogBase&lt;/a&gt;. I think that there is a lot of potential in what I would called a "typed wiki", a wiki who's pages have a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; and that type implies a certain &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; (aka required data). That way you could set up a wiki that contained both free form prose, and also pages that made you fill in a form for certain data. Imagine a baseball wiki. You could have pages on players that required all the typical "baseball card" info and also free formed pages that talked about things like a certain famous game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whit was quite an interesting man, but given my current project schedule, perhaps dangerous to meet with too often. ;-)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-8865485424620632186?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8865485424620632186/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8865485424620632186' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8865485424620632186'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8865485424620632186'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/06/coffee-diffie.html' title='Coffee &amp; Diffie'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-4195883011269629544</id><published>2008-06-23T17:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-23T18:18:41.390-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gif'/><title type='text'>A Twelve Pack of YAPC</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/stage-right-701908.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/stage-right-701904.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got back from Chicago. I really love that place. I usually tell people, "Chicago is a nice place to live, but you wouldn't want to visit there", but I had a great visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went salmon fishing on Lake Michigan with my dad and my brother. We caught 6 fish and drank a few beers, then we met up with mom for a nice family dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got to see my old friends Dave, Brooke, Margy and Emily. They really took good care of me. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I went to Chicago was to speak at my 12th &lt;a href="http://www.yapc.org/"&gt;YAPC&lt;/a&gt; conference. That's me in that picture at the end of my first ever &lt;a href="http://worldnakedbikeride.com/"&gt;naked&lt;/a&gt; impromptu  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk"&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been to 6 North America YAPCs (2001,2002,2003,2005,2006,2008); 5 in Asia (2004-2008) and YAPC Europe in Amsterdam (2001). I've given talks at every one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year's YAPC was really inspiring to me. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall"&gt;Larry Wall&lt;/a&gt;'s talk was the best one I've ever seen him give. I think it rekindled my spirit to work on the following major (for various definitions of major) open source projects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yaml.org/"&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://trac.cdent.org/trac/"&gt;C'Dent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6"&gt;Perl 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jemplate.net/"&gt;Jemplate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/"&gt;Moose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;as well as my many Perl modules like &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Inline/"&gt;Inline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/IO-All/"&gt;IO::All&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/pQuery/"&gt;pQuery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Install/"&gt;Module::Install&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Compile/"&gt;Module::Compile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JS/"&gt;JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WikiText/"&gt;WikiText&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Vroom/"&gt;Vroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of YAPC is always seeing your old Perl friends and making new ones.

Nice to be back to some proper Seattle June weather... cold, wet, miserable. Ah well, we still got the most best coffee houses and I live right in the middle of the that sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I've always gone to the nearest cafe, Online Cafe, for my morning americano. While the coffee and people there are awesome... that's  just criminal. Within 8 blocks of me there is Victrola, Caffe Vita, Bauhaus, Vivace, Fuel, Republik, Stumptown, Presse, and oh so many more. I love these cafes but never go to them on any regular basis. But this week two things changed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became (at least temporarily) a Morning Person. I thought I could avoid the jetlag coming back from Taiwan this year for sure. I did it last year, but alas, this year I got it bad. I woke up every morning at 2:30 or 3am for a whole week. Luckily Victrola opens at 5:30am so by then I was stoked to do something... like get my  coffee. On the second day I figured out how to carry a  coffee on my motorcycle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0794-741340.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0794-740643.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Ducati mod. A MotorCycleCoffeeCozy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can easily go check out a new cafe every morning for like the next 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taiwan was a great trip. I got to hang out with old friends Gugod and TvCafe. The Kogai family treated me to 10 days of bliss in Tokyo. Larry and Gloria Wall were there as well (Perl geek nirvana). I actually sat next to the same person on both of my flights to and from Taiwan and get this... he lives 2 blocks from me in Seattle and his name is Jimi Hendrix! We're going to hang out this weekend. Lyssa from LA came out to spend the last two weeks of Taiwan and Tokyo with me. She really knows Tokyo and I know my way around Taiwan, so it was a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to be back in Seattle and America for a while. Obama FTW!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-26099275489114864?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/26099275489114864/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=26099275489114864' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/26099275489114864'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/26099275489114864'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/06/good-morning-ingy.html' title='Good Morning Ingy'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8107584619021489827</id><published>2008-03-10T14:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-10T19:19:07.621-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Comprehensive Programming Archive Network</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-141-771421.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-141-771416.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I uploaded &lt;a href="http://jquery.com/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/"&gt;CPAN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True. The 'j' in that sentence stands for JavaScript, and the 'P' stands for Perl. So why put a top notch JavaScript library on the world renowned archive network traditionally used for Perl?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it's all just about programming. I have been a major Perl module author since 2000AD. Last time I checked, less than 10 people have more Perl modules on CPAN. For the last 3 years I have been hacking more JavaScript than Perl. I do this mostly for work, but since &lt;a href="http://www.socialtext.com/"&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt; supports Open Source, I have released much of this code as JavaScript modules on &lt;a href="http://openjsan.org/"&gt;JSAN&lt;/a&gt;. I happen to be the only person in the world with a module that is both on JSAN and CPAN; the &lt;a href="http://jemplate.net/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module, because it is half Perl and half JavaScript. (It lets Perl's famous Template Toolkit be used in JavaScript).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JSAN was a really good idea, and led to some key people porting important parts of the Perl packaging framework to JavaScript. Especially the test framework. The result is that there is a fairly standard way to package JavaScript modules, especially if you are a CPAN guy like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that there are only a very small handful of folks paying any attention to the upkeep of JSAN. Truthfully JSAN will never be close to what CPAN is. Fortunately, I have found out it really doesn't need to be. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started toying with the idea of putting other languages on CPAN about 5 years ago, but decided against it after discussing it with some Perl mongers at &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home"&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt;. I also started FreePAN.org in 2003 with the goal of making a CPAN for all languages, but that project never really took off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks ago I started rethinking the whole thing. Certainly most languages have their own strong communities and distribution systems in 2008. But JavaScript (as a language) really doesn't. And almost every project I work on these days involves both Perl and JavaScript. And JSAN made JavaScript modules look like Perl modules. So I decided to look into how hard it would be to leverage CPAN for JavaScript's benefit. It was surprisingly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that if you put any file in the &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;lib/&lt;/span&gt; directory of a CPAN module it will get installed. So, for example, &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;lib/jQuery.js&lt;/span&gt; would be installed when the user runs &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;make install&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I decided that it wouldn't be too cool to put the jQuery package on CPAN and let the user figure out that it was JavaScript and not Perl. Besides, there is already a Perl module called &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JQuery/"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;! I decided to put all these modules in the JS namespace. So jQuery becomes &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JS-jQuery/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;JS-jQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on CPAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what use is it to get JavaScript modules installed on your machine if JavaScript can't find them? I wrote a companion module called &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JS/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;JS.pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This module lets you run a command like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;    &gt; js-cpan jQuery.js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;    /Library/Perl/5.8.8/JS/jQuery.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can get the path names of the JavaScript modules you have on your system. You can then copy or symlink these modules into your web app. With a *nix command like this for example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:courier new;"&gt;    ln -s `js-cpan jQuery.js` jquery.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can distribute Perl web apps on CPAN that require certain JavaScript modules, and have them be included in the standard way as Perl module prerequisites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, I plan to just upload my own JavaScript code to CPAN. But lately, almost everything I write in JavaScript relies on jQuery. It's just &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; good. If JavaScript 2.0 ever comes out, it should have the jQuery core included in the spec. :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-8107584619021489827?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8107584619021489827/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8107584619021489827' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8107584619021489827'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8107584619021489827'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/03/comprehensive-programming-archive.html' title='Comprehensive Programming Archive Network'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5082646728840720236</id><published>2008-02-06T18:40:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-02-06T19:41:42.888-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Year of the Wiki</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/IMG_2790-725503.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/IMG_2790-724254.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Happy new year! It's Chinese New Year. The year of the Rat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rat. Hmm. I don't think I want to spend this whole year giving honor to the Rat. See, I live in America. I've spent the last 7 years under the Rat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm actually very excited about this upcoming year, and the possibilities for doing good things and creating great things. I'm particularly excited about Wikis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2003 I wrote some Wiki software called &lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;Kwiki&lt;/a&gt;. For a while it really started a wildfire, especially in the world of Perl. I set Kwiki up to make the software itself a collaborative experience, much in the way the Wiki is about collaborative content. In the following months and years, many Perl hackers hacked over 250 Kwiki Plugins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Kwiki fell to the sidelines for the last couple years. Last winter it started to surge again only to be stopped dead in its tracks by my accident in Taiwan in the Spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am almost fully recovered and my enthusiasm for Wiki and Kwiki is back in full swing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent this last week at Socialtext in Palo Alto. Socialtext is the original Wiki company and my employer of the last 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last weekend I spent 48 hours in San Francisco, scheming and hacking with Eugene Eric Kim (eek) the father of the Purple Wiki. Eugene and I crafted some very ambitious Wiki plans for 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I am at the Portland Wiki Wednesday, sitting across the table from Ward Cunningham, the inventor of the Wiki itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's definitely been a Wiki Week. I'm getting the feeling that maybe it should be a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wiki Year&lt;/span&gt;. With all due respect to the Chinese, I declare the next year, starting right now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;The Year of the Wiki!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to join me, visit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kwiki.org/"&gt;http://www.kwiki.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;#kwiki on irc.freenode.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-5082646728840720236?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/5082646728840720236/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=5082646728840720236' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5082646728840720236'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5082646728840720236'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2008/02/year-of-wiki.html' title='The Year of the Wiki'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-1559340787095737307</id><published>2007-11-28T19:53:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-12-01T18:39:13.700-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Hackers Will Always Overcome</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-84-734784.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/Photo-84-734780.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I bought a ticket to go to Taiwan in December, but later decided to postpone the trip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The departure date was next week so I knew I'd better call today and cancel it. I called the airline at 5:15pm and they told me to use their website to cancel it. So I hung up and surfed on over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After finally navigating this very crufty site to the cancellation page, I filled out the form and clicked the CONFIRM button. The page simply zipped to the top and did nothing. Strange. I tried again. Same thing. I looked around to find a better button to click. Nada.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So being a hacker I viewed the source code for the button and saw that it called the "validate_data" javascript function. I tried entering in some bad data, and it gave me alerts saying that my data was bad. Then I fixed all the bad data again and nothing. again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At this point I said fµck it and called them back... I'm sorry, the office is now closed... office hours are from 9am to 5:30pm...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; FµCK! This time I really said ƒµçk it!! I'm a hacker! I'm going to hack this site and make it work!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I fired up Firebug and did a &lt;tt&gt;document.getElementsByTagName('form')&lt;/tt&gt;. Cool! Just one form. I clicked on the result and firebug showed me the guts of the form. It all looked good. Then I saw &lt;tt&gt;onsubmit="return validate_data()"&lt;/tt&gt;. That stupid stupid JS function. &lt;tt&gt;document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].removeAttribute('onsubmit')&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buh-bye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now I went back and clicked CONFIRM again. Nothing... Hmm. Is this button even part of the form? Oh ƒµçk it. Who needs a &lt;em&gt;button&lt;/em&gt; to submit a form? &lt;tt&gt;document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit()&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voilà!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Don't let crappy e-commerce sites get you down.

It makes me believe in life a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delightful man named Fling, whom I've never met before just walked up to me whilst I was working at Online Cafe. Yes, Fling. Yes, Online Cafe. None of this is made up. (I'm just not that creative!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fling asked me "Is your name Ingy"... Yes... I found your passport on the street... (jaw drops)... wait here and I'll run home and get it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two nights ago I got back from visiting my coworkers in Vancouver. I guess in the process of unpacking my car, the passport fell out. I had actually noticed it right away, and figured it was safe inside the car somewhere. Today when I got to the cafe, it crossed my mind to go get it from the car. Luckily I put it off and stayed in the cafe so Fling could find me, instead of going into a major freakout that would have ensued, since I need that passport to get back to Vancouver tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fling rocks. Life is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of life, I attended the funeral reception for the passing on of my good friend Meghan's&lt;br /&gt;father, yesterday. The Tesh-s are a great family, and we all had a good time enjoying the comfort of friendships, and toasting to the life of Don Tesh. I only met him once, but he had an important effect on my life... He was the retired doctor who referred me to my most excellent wrist surgeon in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest in peace, Don.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-6660080807286313043?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/6660080807286313043/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=6660080807286313043' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6660080807286313043'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/6660080807286313043'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/10/fling-me-passport.html' title='Fling, Me, A Passport'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5327378868013006281</id><published>2007-09-11T22:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-09-12T11:57:19.933-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Alter Ego And Edamame</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/1364627078_d3c1276e8e-780770.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/1364627078_d3c1276e8e-780762.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I had dinner with &lt;a href="http://ingypants.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-dinner-with-ingy.html"&gt;Ingy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://ingypants.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-dinner-with-ingy.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I got together and dined with my local alter ego, Ingy Pants. We ate at Seattle's best sushi restaurant, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=maneki+seattle&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;Maneki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We babeled a bit about French and Chinese language, various arm surgeries, and the 4 "P" languages (Perl, Python, PHP and Ruby).

But then I get wanderlust and takes to all kinds of great places in this great world. Still I have my favorites. The are the cities that I just feel at home in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;新竹 （Ｈsinchu)&lt;/span&gt; - This is the Taiwan city that I lived in for 6 months. Also the one that recently tried to eat my wrist. Still I love it and can't wait to get back. I &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; learn Chinese before I die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/span&gt; - Couver is a techie's haven. And it is naturally beautiful. And full of my favorite people. And it has the Excellent Eatery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Portland&lt;/span&gt; - Portland peeps are real. I love it there. Where else can you find over half a dozen movie theaters with beer and pizza?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Seattle&lt;/span&gt; - You always get me back. But I'll always leave you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hmm. What do these places all have in common? Great bicycle riding. Decent weather year round (except 新竹 in the summer). Ocean, mountains, flats and lush green. Great food (the best outside of Chicago, which is really the only city I can recommend for food). Technology. High cost of living (Couver is a bitch). Great people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'm ready to make a next move, Seattle... where shall I go?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-4769412926996800435?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/4769412926996800435/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=4769412926996800435' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/4769412926996800435'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/4769412926996800435'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/08/trail-of-four-cities.html' title='Trail of Four Cities'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-5168822042538569354</id><published>2007-06-27T15:59:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-06-28T13:33:44.521-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Post Op Days</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF1031-716293.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF1031-715701.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been almost a month since I wrote here. A week after I wrote that I went to the Swedish hospital for wrist surgery. In a word, the surgery was "good". The doc keeps his cards pretty close to his chest, but I could tell he was pretty excited about the turnout. That's the good news...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...life has been so low key since then. My wrist is going to be in the healing phase for the next year I think. It doesn't bend so much now, and I guess fixing that takes a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have been steadily doing some low key but fun stuff. I went on a trip to Portland last weekend. I love that town. I'm always tempted to move back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past weekend my buddies Tatsuhiko Miyagawa and Steve Howell, were both in town. Monday night we all went to watch the Mariners beat the crap out of the Red Sox. I don't go to many baseball games, but can someone please tell me why every other fan at Safeco Field was cheering for Boston?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Miyagawa had a good time. I'm not in the best shape to host people I think. But the weather was great and we got out a bit. Friday night I had my first BBQ party in nearly a year. I'm ready for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ever since this surgery I've been sleeping more than ever. At first I thought it was the sleep drugs, but I've stopped taking those, and I'm still a zombie half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else? I've been spending some time writing my new Perl module, YAML::XS. It's exciting because Perl has been dieing for top notch YAML support, and YAML::XS is just that. It is a C binding to Kirill Siminov's libyaml library. The "top notch" credit all goes to Kirill. libyaml is simply amazing. I think Kirill is to programming, what Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was to music. Well I just get the feeling that Kirill makes no mistakes. I haven't found a single bug in this opus of code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I got out on my motorcycle! Technically I should probably wait a couple more weeks, but man... I gotta live. It was great to ride a few miles. Yesterday I rode my road bike for a bit, and last week I started running again. I'm still loving being alive. I think getting the pace of your life slowed down can be a good thing. It helps you notice all the good stuff around you.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-5168822042538569354?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/5168822042538569354/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=5168822042538569354' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5168822042538569354'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/5168822042538569354'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/06/its-been-almost-month-since-i-wrote.html' title='Post Op Days'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8900582427570006989</id><published>2007-05-30T13:12:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-30T13:28:35.182-07:00</updated><title type='text'>One Less Fixie</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0974-746080.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0974-745142.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I talked to the doc yesterday. Last week he told me the "external fixator" would need to be on 8 weeks total, or about 3 more weeks. But then yesterday he talked me into doing a wrist surgery next week. Since I agreed, he now wants to take the bionics off the arm ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny... I completely agree with him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today at 4pm I become a relatively normal looking dude again. No more wrist piercing jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the surgery, I think he's going to break off the end of my radius into a few pieces and do his best to make it more like it should be. Then he'll hold it all steady with internal screwed in plates. What could possibly go wrong?!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-8900582427570006989?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8900582427570006989/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8900582427570006989' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8900582427570006989'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8900582427570006989'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/one-less-fixie.html' title='One Less Fixie'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3953131606703729200.post-8863215351804982558</id><published>2007-05-20T16:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-20T17:22:16.538-07:00</updated><title type='text'>index.yaml</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0902-727096.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://blog.ingy.net/uploaded_images/DSCF0902-726139.JPG" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent part of my morning at Target and Barnes &amp; Noble. I'm not much of a mall guy at all, and I never ever buy anything from St4rbucks. Still I do like getting my undies at Target and B&amp;amp;N was next door, and my friend wanted to get a Sudoku book. So I do what I always do in a corporate chain book store... I look in the computer section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must first say that I am happy to report that computer books are finally on the decline. There's just half a normal sized aisle's worth, and half of that is mandatory Microcrap stuff (this is Seattle after all). Perl is (sadly) all but gone. The only new rage seems to be Ajax and a gaggle of JavaScript books. Nothing wrong with that, just not too exciting to me. I mean how much can you really say about either?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to look at the indexes of some new books and see if there was the word "YAML" in any of them. (Yes, ego browsing). First I have to say that not many computer terms at all begin with the letter Y. I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;yield&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YUI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YAGNI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Kind of redundant. YUI *is* Yahoo! (and also YAGNI ihmo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did find a few books with YAML in the index. At least one had a decent amount of YAML in the content of the book. Here's what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Rails-Scott-Raymond/dp/0596527446"&gt;Ajax on Rails&lt;/a&gt; - YAML isn't needed in Ajax so much, but Ruby and Rails really like YAML. This book only mentioned YAML in passing, and errantly thought it stood for Yet Another Markup Language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly-Lucas-Carlson/dp/0596523696"&gt;Ruby Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; - Ruby has shipped with native YAML support for years. This book had quite a bit of YAML info/examples/usage/etc. It seemed fairly accurate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Web-Development-Rails-Programmers/dp/097669400X"&gt;Agile Web Development with Rails&lt;/a&gt; - This book got the name wrong too but just by one letter: "YAML Ain't a Markup Language".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intermediate-Perl-Randal-L-Schwartz/dp/0596102062"&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/a&gt; - This book (written about my native computer tongue) talks about YAML. Unfortunately the examples are really old and dated (YAML 1.0) even though the book was reprinted in 2006. Also the book attributes the YAML creation to some bloke named "Brian Ingerson". We all know YAML was invented by Evans, Ben-Kiki and döt Net.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perl-Hacks-Programming-Debugging-Surviving/dp/0596526741"&gt;PERL HACKS&lt;/a&gt; - This one blasphemously puts Perl in ALL CAPS on the cover, even though the author's name is purposefully all lower case. The content contains one HACK involving YAML.pm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm sure there are more books out there that mention YAML. It got me thinking about maybe writing a book about YAML. It also got me thinking about how to start getting YAML support in browsers.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3953131606703729200-8863215351804982558?l=blog.ingy.net' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/8863215351804982558/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3953131606703729200&amp;postID=8863215351804982558' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8863215351804982558'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3953131606703729200/posts/default/8863215351804982558'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.ingy.net/2007/05/indexyaml.html' title='index.yaml'/><author><name>ingydotnet</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13816997957671633491</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='01569326523090772403'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry></feed>
